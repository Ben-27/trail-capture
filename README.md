# trail-capture
Paper.io-like mini game. 

## Motivation
My son has downloaded dozens of games onto my phone. I enjoy Paper.io's gameplay but find myself quitting because of overcommercialization--adds, chests, in-game store. Therefore, my goal is to create a simple game focused on gameplay with the ability to customize it to inspire my son to solve problems and make his own additions.

## Basic Concepts
Players move around the board trying to both capture new regions and reset the other player by colliding with their trail. Regions are captured when it is enclosed between the player's tail and existing region. The game is over when only one player still has a region.

Code is meant to run within Python and not as its own executable.

## Next Steps
1. Basic gameplay
2. Main menu to adjust settings and launch game
3. Fun additions (obstacles, power ups, etc.)
4. Have fun.
